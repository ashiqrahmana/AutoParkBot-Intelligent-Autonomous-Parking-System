# AutoParkBot-Intelligent-Autonomous-Parking-System
## Project Objective
To design and build a bot that can autonomously detect parking spaces and park itself. It was also designed to detect if the vehicle present in the parking space is a 2-wheeleer or a 4-wheeler

## System Architecture
The bot has Arduino as the primary microcontroller. It takes in the sensor data and control the servos for the bot movement  

## Onboard Sensors
| Sensor | Type | Function | 
| ------ | ---- | -------- |
| QTI | IR | Line Following |
| HC-SR04 | Ultrasonic | Obstacle and vehicle detection |

## Circuit
To design and build a bot that can autonomously detect parking spaces and park itself. It was also designed to detect if the vehicle present in the parking space is a 2-wheeleer or a 4-wheeler  

## Approach
